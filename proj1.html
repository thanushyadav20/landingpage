   <h style="font-size: 40px;"><b>What is a chatbox?  </b></h>
   <p style="font-size: 25px;">Chatbox refers to the interface that allows users to interact with a chat application. It typically appears as a small window or pop-up on a website and includes a text input field for the user to type in their message and a button to initiate the chat with an AI chatbot or a live agent. Chatboxes are often used for customer service, technical support, or sales inquiries. They can also include features such as quick selection options, file sharing, and the ability for the representative to initiate the chat</p>

   <td class="cd"><h style="font-size: 35px;" > <b>Why should you offer chatbox for customer support?</b></h> <p style="font-size: 20px;">We are in an age where a customer typically interacts with a brand via several touchpoints before buying. You need to be online and available when they are seeking information. You don’t want to make it difficult for them to get in touch with you. Instead of making your customers search for your contact email or phone number, you can initiate a chat with them proactively or allow them to start a conversation with you, while they are online on your website. More importantly, having an online chatbox helps you have a personalized conversation with your prospect.</p></td>
